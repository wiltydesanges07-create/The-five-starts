Must have.

   -The user must follow at least one lesson per day.               
   -Each day, the user should set a goal and achieve it.                       
   -The user must take level assessment evaluation every week.

  Maybe.

   -The user would be encouraged to reflect on least one proverb each day.
   -They should also participate in a daily conversation to renforce their practice and fluency.

  It would be good if.

   -Users could connnect their entries to communicate with each other.
